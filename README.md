# Chess-Game-Movement-Demo
 A chess simulation demonstrating precise movement through my coded implementation. Experience virtual chess strategies and moves come to life.

Hey everyone! 

Just dropped my second Unity project here. This one's all about diving into programming and coding. I've been exploring the ins and outs of C# within Unity, figuring out how these scripts dance together in the game engine.
While coding might still throw me a few curveballs, this project has been an exciting journey. I'm determined to conquer coding because my dream is to become a game developer!

This project is a hands-on exploration of coding chess piece movements according to their rules. For instance, the knight can only do its signature L-move, while the bishop glides diagonally. I've set it up so pieces can move on the green plate, but if there's an opponent, the plate goes redâ€”signaling a showdown!
And hey, if pieces from the same family (black or white) get in the way, the green light stops there. Play a round, and you'll see what I mean.

Top it off: once you checkmate the opponent's king, victory gets celebrated, and you can tap to dive right back in.
Check out my implementation and feedback is always appreciated

Thank you for checking out my game!

### Potential enhancements:
1.**User-friendly UI and Main Menu**: I envision incorporating a polished user interface and an engaging main menu to create a seamless and immersive experience for players.

2.**Enhanced Graphics**: To enrich the visual appeal, I'm considering upgrading the graphics to offer players a more captivating and visually pleasing environment.

3.**Soldier's Starting Move**: In accordance with chess rules, enhancing the soldier's moves to allow for two steps forward from its starting position would introduce a greater strategic depth to the game.

4.**Checkmate Notifications**: For heightened engagement, the game could offer real-time notifications when a king is in a "check" state, urging the opposing player to move the king. If a king is cornered with no possible moves left, the game would initiate the "checkmate" state, bringing a thrilling conclusion.

5.**AI Opponent Implementation**: By introducing an AI opponent, players can hone their skills against a dynamic and challenging virtual adversary, enhancing the game's allure.

6.**Player Choice of Side**: Adding a feature that allows players to select their preferred side, either white or black, would personalize the gaming experience and provide an opportunity to explore different strategies.

7.**Refined "Winner" UI**: Designing an enhanced "winner" user interface that celebrates the victor in a more captivating and rewarding manner, offering a satisfying end to each game.
